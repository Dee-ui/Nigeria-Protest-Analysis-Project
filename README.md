## Project Description

These are some of the questions I had in mind when I embarked on this data analysis project. In recent days, waves of protests have come to meet us this early August and many Nigerians  and Businesses wonder what this development holds in store for them.

This project aims to utilize artificial intelligence and data analytics tools (SQL, Power BI, Excel and Python) to throw more illumination into the causes, impacts and effects of protests in Nigeria.

## Methodology

The data for this project was collated from distinct sources namely;

- SCADAFRICA protest data on African and Southern American countries.

- Twitter API for posts and articles related to protests and protests in Nigeria.

Natural language processing using python libraries like NLTK, Scikit-Learn, TfidfVectorizer, re, wordcloud, etc. was used to process text data and garner insights like 'Major reasons for protests in Nigeria", "Main causes of protests in Nigeria", etc.

Power Bi in conjuction with SQL and Excel was used to create databses, clean data, extract insights and profer an advanced data analysis dashboard to show "Major Areas of Protests in the Country", "Major casualties suffered during protests", etc.
